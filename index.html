            <p>’Robotics’ have revolutionized the concept of learning and brought technology to the class rooms. At Lancer’s we provide a structured course to the students wherein they program their robots to perform various operations. The school has a fully equipped Robotics Lab which allows students to access science and technology via multiple angles.

                Robotics opens up a plethora of opportunities for the students. Industries across a range of sectors such as automotive and atomic energy use Robotic technologies. We at Lancers, in association with Robotics Wizards have successfully inculcated Educational Robotics in our curriculum. It is a broad term that refers to a collection of activities, instructional programs, physical platforms, educational resources and pedagogical philosophy directed with an objective to provide a set of experiences to facilitate the student's development of knowledge, skills and attitudes for the design, analysis, application and operation of robots. Students are also given opportunity to demonstrate their acquired skills in competitions like Robo-Cups. Robotics is introduced to students from as early as class 4 and continues till class 10. A competent faculty regular sessions and a set of Robo kit arm the students with the required skills.</p>

                <p id="his">All great ideas begin with a commitment to the future. It is with this steadfast endeavour and in the quest for excellence that Reverend Sqdn. Ldr. A.S.Mann spearheaded the project of establishing the school with the eminent apex body of the Anand Education Society. Thus, the dream child ‘Century Tagore School’ in Ashok Vihar (1974) was born. The holistic education provided by the school soon earned a good name and the need for a spacious school, which could accommodate more students, was felt. With the divine blessings of Bhagwan Sri Sathya Sai Baba, four acres of land was allotted at Prashant Vihar. Thus Lancer’s Convent, Senior Secondary School, one of the premier institutions of North Delhi, affiliated to CBSE came into being. Since then, the school has contributed immensely to nurture intellectual property who are leaving their significant mark in the global arena. The Tree of Knowledge is growing since aeons.

Lancer's International is a venture of the Lancer’s Group of Schools. It flaunts a picturesque campus with state – of – art infrastructure. Besides world class - rooms and labs, the school has aesthetically designed sports grounds, tennis court, basket-ball court, residential facilities for students, academic resources, cafeteria and many more facilities to make a satisfying living for the students.</p>
